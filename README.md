# Coven-Undone
Coven Undone Modpack Github for collecting and tracking issues

## Packtester Input
Thanks to everyone who has tried Coven Undone in its earliest stages! I put together some questions that would help me improve the pack into a beta release, so if you would like to help Coven Undone, I would love to hear you're input!

Regardless, please hit up the [Discord](https://discord.gg/CCnupA8), if only to say hi! Thanks again to everyone!

#### What feels grindy?
- While this pack should be hard, I don't want it to be a complete grind
- Does it feel like a grind because it takes forever and theres no way to speed it up, or because you should have built a better farm to make a given item for you? Is something too rare?
- What would be an alternative that will keep the recipe/stage interesting but may relieve some of the grind?

#### What does not feel cohesive?
- This should apply to many things as I want the whole pack to feel like a well thought through game, not a hodge-podge of mods thrown together.
- Do any textures that are important/core not make sense or don't fit in?
- Do any recipes not make sense?
- Is there any world generation that is too much or looks bad?
- Is there any mod I should or shouldn't use in order to add to the feel of the game?
- Does the narrative/quest text need improving?

#### What is well explained
- This is definitely geared towards people who have experienced most of these mods before, however I don't want anyone to get lost.
- Are there any lesser-used mods that could use a bit more explaining?
- Did you ever think, "I wish I had known that", or get stuck for a while trying to figure out a recipe or how to get an item or block?

#### Has anything been forgotten?
- Is there an item that needs a recipe change?
- Is there something too OP?
- Is there something underpowered/overpriced?
- Any 'basic' item you wish you had earlier access too?
- Any item that is irrelevant by the time you're able to craft it?

#### Ideas
- I would love to hear more ideas about anything!
- What machines could I incorporate in various stages of the game for greater variety (*\*\*ehhm Sariras*)?
- What items should I better showcase?
- What boss battles are you looking for?

#### Help
- Endgame: Whether or not you got there in testing, I'm curious on you're thoughts on endgame. Obviously AE2 is very far back in the pack, but I still want players to feel like they've got stuff to do and automate with it. What are some post AE2 goals players may like? Is going the crazy creative item routes attractive to you? My current idea is some difficult automation "challenges", but I'm hoping for something even more creative.
